These include early land holdings, 19th century newspaper accounts of the early college, Civil War records copied form the National Archives, as well as the first student newpapers.

With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists.

Mason was born January 1, 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his family moved to Washington, D.C. when he was a young boy. He graduated from Washington's Roosevelt High School, and entered GW in 1918. Mason earned an B.A. in 1923, and an M.A. in 1925 both concentrating in English. 

Mason began working in the library while an undergraduate and was appointed Chief Assistant in 1920. He was made Assistant Librarian following his gradation, a post he held until 1929. He decided to dedicate his career to librarianship, and enrolled in the Library School of Columbia University. Before finishing at Columbia in 1933, Mason was promoted at GW from Associate Librarian to the position of Chief Librarian the same year. In 1939, the Lisner Library was constructed and during Mason's service, the library holdings increased fourfold, including the purchase of the library of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1950. 

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later. 

He was a member of the American Library Association, the Library Association of Great Britain, the District of Columbia Library Association (serving as President from 1942 to 1944), the Special Libraries Association, the American Guild of Organists, Theta Delta Chi, the Cosmos Club, and the Arts Club of Washington. In 1974, the Friends of the Libraries dedicated the John Russell Mason Room in the University Library (named Gelman Library in 1980). 

He continued his life of bachelorhood at his long residence in the Arts Club of Washington until his death. John Russell Mason died February 28, 1981 in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Mason's will provided for the establishment of a $220,000 permanent endowment for the purchase of books for the Gelman Library, known as the John Russell Mason Book Fund.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962. 

This was written in 2005.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

 Logo for KFRC, the Mutual station in San Francisco, owned by the Don Lee Broadcasting System.Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent.[44] The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

After years of preserving the objects entrusted to their care, there was a realization that no attempt was being made to preserve the history of our
museums. As one of the oldest American museums, the Corcoran Gallery of Art joined in the early stages of this movement by creating a repository for the records which document the Gallery's history. The organization of these historic documents has benefited both staff members and scholars who are interested in the Gallery's past activities.

In 2008, due to space reduction, most of the archives' holdings had to be reboxed and were shipped to offsite storage. However, transfer of materials from the Corcoran's various departments to the archives continued until 2014.",prefercite

Some of these accessions represent excellent documentation of the early years of the University, both in written and visual form. These include early land holdings, 19th century newspaper accounts of the early college, Civil War records copied form the National Archives, as well as the first student newpapers. Many are surmised to have come from the office of University Historian Elmer Louis Kayser, who was associated with the University as a student and faculty member from 1914-85.

In 2016 and 2017, with the reprocessing of the Office of the President records, some series of photographs and memorabilia were moved into RG0031, and some series and boxes of records from the office of the president were moved into RG0002, resulting in the current series numbering.

The Dimock (named for Susan Dimock Catalini, a University benefactor) opened in 1966, and is an educational gallery which provides a professional setting for the display of art on The George Washington University campus. With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

 Logo for KFRC, the Mutual station in San Francisco, owned by the Don Lee Broadcasting System.Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent.[44] The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

In 1888, Edward Baltzley purchased 516 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1889, he and his brother Edwin founded the E &amp; E Baltzley Realty Company and began selling the property as residential lots. In 1891, they established the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo. Glen Echo was also home to Clara Barton and the headquarters of the American Red Cross in this period. In 1903, the Baltzleys lost their holdings in a foreclosure and the property was purchased by Washington Railway and Electric Company. In 1911, Washington Railway and Electric (under the name Glen Echo Park Company) decided to run their own amusement park on the site as a way to both boost weekend railway ticket sales and use surplus electricity. The park closed in 1968, and was obtained by the National Park Service in 1971.

The Dimock (named for Susan Dimock Catalini, a University benefactor) opened in 1966, and is an educational gallery which provides a professional setting for the display of art on The George Washington University campus. With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C. Kline (June 1973-June 1975); and Lenore Miller (July 1975- ).

Mason was born January 1, 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his family moved to Washington, D.C. when he was a young boy. He graduated from Washington's Roosevelt High School, and entered GW in 1918. Mason earned an B.A. in 1923, and an M.A. in 1925 both concentrating in English. 

Mason began working in the library while an undergraduate and was appointed Chief Assistant in 1920. He was made Assistant Librarian following his gradation, a post he held until 1929. He decided to dedicate his career to librarianship, and enrolled in the Library School of Columbia University. Before finishing at Columbia in 1933, Mason was promoted at GW from Associate Librarian to the position of Chief Librarian the same year. In 1939, the Lisner Library was constructed and during Mason's service, the library holdings increased fourfold, including the purchase of the library of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1950. 

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later. 

He was a member of the American Library Association, the Library Association of Great Britain, the District of Columbia Library Association (serving as President from 1942 to 1944), the Special Libraries Association, the American Guild of Organists, Theta Delta Chi, the Cosmos Club, and the Arts Club of Washington. In 1974, the Friends of the Libraries dedicated the John Russell Mason Room in the University Library (named Gelman Library in 1980). 

He continued his life of bachelorhood at his long residence in the Arts Club of Washington until his death. John Russell Mason died February 28, 1981 in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Mason's will provided for the establishment of a $220,000 permanent endowment for the purchase of books for the Gelman Library, known as the John Russell Mason Book Fund.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies).

With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists.

Mason was born January 1, 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his family moved to Washington, D.C. when he was a young boy. He graduated from Washington's Roosevelt High School, and entered GW in 1918. Mason earned an B.A. in 1923, and an M.A. in 1925 both concentrating in English. 

Mason began working in the library while an undergraduate and was appointed Chief Assistant in 1920. He was made Assistant Librarian following his gradation, a post he held until 1929. He decided to dedicate his career to librarianship, and enrolled in the Library School of Columbia University. Before finishing at Columbia in 1933, Mason was promoted at GW from Associate Librarian to the position of Chief Librarian the same year. In 1939, the Lisner Library was constructed and during Mason's service, the library holdings increased fourfold, including the purchase of the library of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1950. 

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later. 

He was a member of the American Library Association, the Library Association of Great Britain, the District of Columbia Library Association (serving as President from 1942 to 1944), the Special Libraries Association, the American Guild of Organists, Theta Delta Chi, the Cosmos Club, and the Arts Club of Washington. In 1974, the Friends of the Libraries dedicated the John Russell Mason Room in the University Library (named Gelman Library in 1980). 

He continued his life of bachelorhood at his long residence in the Arts Club of Washington until his death. John Russell Mason died February 28, 1981 in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Mason's will provided for the establishment of a $220,000 permanent endowment for the purchase of books for the Gelman Library, known as the John Russell Mason Book Fund.

He continued his life of bachelorhood at his long residence in the Arts Club of Washington until his death. John Russell Mason died February 28, 1981 in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Mason's will provided for the establishment of a $220,000 permanent endowment for the purchase of books for the Gelman Library, known as the John Russell Mason Book Fund.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

 Logo for KFRC, the Mutual station in San Francisco, owned by the Don Lee Broadcasting System.Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent.[44] The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

After years of preserving the objects entrusted to their care, there was a realization that no attempt was being made to preserve the history of our
museums. As one of the oldest American museums, the Corcoran Gallery of Art joined in the early stages of this movement by creating a repository for the records which document the Gallery's history. The organization of these historic documents has benefited both staff members and scholars who are interested in the Gallery's past activities.

In 2008, due to space reduction, most of the archives' holdings had to be reboxed and were shipped to offsite storage. However, transfer of materials from the Corcoran's various departments to the archives continued until 2014.",prefercite

Some of these accessions represent excellent documentation of the early years of the University, both in written and visual form. These include early land holdings, 19th century newspaper accounts of the early college, Civil War records copied form the National Archives, as well as the first student newpapers. Many are surmised to have come from the office of University Historian Elmer Louis Kayser, who was associated with the University as a student and faculty member from 1914-85.

In 2016 and 2017, with the reprocessing of the Office of the President records, some series of photographs and memorabilia were moved into RG0031, and some series and boxes of records from the office of the president were moved into RG0002, resulting in the current series numbering.

The Dimock (named for Susan Dimock Catalini, a University benefactor) opened in 1966, and is an educational gallery which provides a professional setting for the display of art on The George Washington University campus. With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

 Logo for KFRC, the Mutual station in San Francisco, owned by the Don Lee Broadcasting System.Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent.[44] The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

In 1888, Edward Baltzley purchased 516 acres in Montgomery County, Maryland. In 1889, he and his brother Edwin founded the E &amp; E Baltzley Realty Company and began selling the property as residential lots. In 1891, they established the National Chautauqua of Glen Echo. Glen Echo was also home to Clara Barton and the headquarters of the American Red Cross in this period. In 1903, the Baltzleys lost their holdings in a foreclosure and the property was purchased by Washington Railway and Electric Company. In 1911, Washington Railway and Electric (under the name Glen Echo Park Company) decided to run their own amusement park on the site as a way to both boost weekend railway ticket sales and use surplus electricity. The park closed in 1968, and was obtained by the National Park Service in 1971.

The Dimock (named for Susan Dimock Catalini, a University benefactor) opened in 1966, and is an educational gallery which provides a professional setting for the display of art on The George Washington University campus. With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

/repositories/2/resources/638,Dimock Gallery records,RG0087,['39'],['resource'],"The Dimock Gallery of The George Washington University resides in the Lisner Auditorium, built in 1941. The Dimock (named for Susan Dimock Catalini, a University benefactor) opened in 1966, and is an educational gallery which provides a professional setting for the display of art on The George Washington University campus. With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C. Kline (June 1973-June 1975); and Lenore Miller (July 1975- ).

Mason was born January 1, 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his family moved to Washington, D.C. when he was a young boy. He graduated from Washington's Roosevelt High School, and entered GW in 1918. Mason earned an B.A. in 1923, and an M.A. in 1925 both concentrating in English. 

Mason began working in the library while an undergraduate and was appointed Chief Assistant in 1920. He was made Assistant Librarian following his gradation, a post he held until 1929. He decided to dedicate his career to librarianship, and enrolled in the Library School of Columbia University. Before finishing at Columbia in 1933, Mason was promoted at GW from Associate Librarian to the position of Chief Librarian the same year. In 1939, the Lisner Library was constructed and during Mason's service, the library holdings increased fourfold, including the purchase of the library of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1950. 

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later. 

He was a member of the American Library Association, the Library Association of Great Britain, the District of Columbia Library Association (serving as President from 1942 to 1944), the Special Libraries Association, the American Guild of Organists, Theta Delta Chi, the Cosmos Club, and the Arts Club of Washington.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists.

Mason was born January 1, 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his family moved to Washington, D.C. when he was a young boy. He graduated from Washington's Roosevelt High School, and entered GW in 1918. Mason earned an B.A. in 1923, and an M.A. in 1925 both concentrating in English. 

Mason began working in the library while an undergraduate and was appointed Chief Assistant in 1920. He was made Assistant Librarian following his gradation, a post he held until 1929. He decided to dedicate his career to librarianship, and enrolled in the Library School of Columbia University. Before finishing at Columbia in 1933, Mason was promoted at GW from Associate Librarian to the position of Chief Librarian the same year. In 1939, the Lisner Library was constructed and during Mason's service, the library holdings increased fourfold, including the purchase of the library of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1950. 

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later. 

He was a member of the American Library Association, the Library Association of Great Britain, the District of Columbia Library Association (serving as President from 1942 to 1944), the Special Libraries Association, the American Guild of Organists, Theta Delta Chi, the Cosmos Club, and the Arts Club of Washington. In 1974, the Friends of the Libraries dedicated the John Russell Mason Room in the University Library (named Gelman Library in 1980). 

He continued his life of bachelorhood at his long residence in the Arts Club of Washington until his death. John Russell Mason died February 28, 1981 in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Mason's will provided for the establishment of a $220,000 permanent endowment for the purchase of books for the Gelman Library, known as the John Russell Mason Book Fund.

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later. 

He was a member of the American Library Association, the Library Association of Great Britain, the District of Columbia Library Association (serving as President from 1942 to 1944), the Special Libraries Association, the American Guild of Organists, Theta Delta Chi, the Cosmos Club, and the Arts Club of Washington. In 1974, the Friends of the Libraries dedicated the John Russell Mason Room in the University Library (named Gelman Library in 1980). 

He continued his life of bachelorhood at his long residence in the Arts Club of Washington until his death. John Russell Mason died February 28, 1981 in Washington, D.C. In 1983, Mason's will provided for the establishment of a $220,000 permanent endowment for the purchase of books for the Gelman Library, known as the John Russell Mason Book Fund.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

 Logo for KFRC, the Mutual station in San Francisco, owned by the Don Lee Broadcasting System.Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent.[44] The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.

After years of preserving the objects entrusted to their care, there was a realization that no attempt was being made to preserve the history of our
museums. As one of the oldest American museums, the Corcoran Gallery of Art joined in the early stages of this movement by creating a repository for the records which document the Gallery's history. The organization of these historic documents has benefited both staff members and scholars who are interested in the Gallery's past activities.

In 2008, due to space reduction, most of the archives' holdings had to be reboxed and were shipped to offsite storage. However, transfer of materials from the Corcoran's various departments to the archives continued until 2014.",prefercite

Some of these accessions represent excellent documentation of the early years of the University, both in written and visual form. These include early land holdings, 19th century newspaper accounts of the early college, Civil War records copied form the National Archives, as well as the first student newpapers. Many are surmised to have come from the office of University Historian Elmer Louis Kayser, who was associated with the University as a student and faculty member from 1914-85.

In 2016 and 2017, with the reprocessing of the Office of the President records, some series of photographs and memorabilia were moved into RG0031, and some series and boxes of records from the office of the president were moved into RG0002, resulting in the current series numbering.

The Dimock (named for Susan Dimock Catalini, a University benefactor) opened in 1966, and is an educational gallery which provides a professional setting for the display of art on The George Washington University campus. With the active support of Department of Fine Arts and Art History students, the Dimock Gallery's mission provides for a ""hands-on"" experience for curating and presenting their creative endeavors. Ongoing student and faculty participation provides a forum for students to curate, display, and critique their creative efforts, and creates a learning environment in which students can organize exhibitions and learn about exhibition design with the advice of faculty and curators. From time to time, exhibitions will be staged in conjunction with Lisner Auditorium performances, such as Flamenco Festivals, other international collaborations, and academic programs. 

Douglas Teller joined the faculty at GW in 1962 and retired after a long and successful teaching career in 1995. A professor of design and printmaking, he taught courses in design, serigraphy, and watercolor as well. He forged new ground for printmaking within the University and for the Washington area, serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Society of Washington Printmakers. When John Russell Mason, University Librarian and Curator of Art, retired in 1966, a void was created. It was filled by Professor Teller, who became the Dimock Gallery's first curator (1966-69). He established the university's gallery as a showcase for the university and Washington area, augmenting the contemporary arts holdings, and acknowledging GW's cultural and educational responsibilities to its students and local artists. Teller was succeeded as Curator of Art by Evelyn Stolte (September 1969-December 1971 and September 1972-May 1973); Gail Obenreder (January-June 1972); Donald C.

In 1939, the Lisner Library was constructed and during Mason's service, the library holdings increased fourfold, including the purchase of the library of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in 1950. 

In 1944, he was given the added responsibly of being the Curator of Art. In that capacity he arranged 176 exhibitions of works of art which ranged from the Walter P. Chrysler Collection to the annual student shows. He was instrumental in the acquisition of two full length Gilbert Stuart portraits of George Washington, a Rembrandt Peale ""porthole"" portrait, and the oil portraits of presidents of the University. 

An accomplished organist, Mason played at numerous universality convocations and commencements for over thirty-five years. He also played for a number of Washington churches, among them Central Presbyterian Church from 1926 to 1944 as the organist. In 1951, the University honored him with an alumni achievement award, and in 1965 he was confirmed the status of Librarian and Curator of Art Emeritus. He retired officially a year later.

/repositories/2/resources/677,Jacob Burns Law Library records,RG0129,['504'],['resource'],"The Jacob Burns Law Library is the library for the National Law Center of The George Washington University (GW) . The library building was completed in 1967. The library is named after a prominent New York lawyer, who was a 1924 graduate of the National Law Center and started the building project by donating $500,000. The library began within the regulations of government for the new law school in 1826 stipulated that ""Each student before he can receive a ticket to the Professors for admission to the Law Lectures, shall pay ten dollars to the Treasurer of the College, for the purpose of defraying the expenses of, and increasing the Law Library, to be expended under the direction of the Professors of Law, for the sole use of the school.""

The Law Library, part of Columbian College's Law School, was first located in Columbia Heights. From 1865 to 1884 the Library was at old Trinity Church 416 5th St. NW and then moved to the University Building at 15th and H St. NW through 1899. During this time the library was a room with an attached reading room. In 1899, the Law Library moved to the Law Lecture Hall on H St. east of 15th St. till 1910. Here the library had most of the third floor and the reading room contained wicker furniture with shelves against the wall. Then the library relocated to the rented upper floors of the Masonic Temple's auditorium's balcony on 13th St. and New York Ave. NW for the next ten years. In 1920, the Law Library transfered to the old Justice Department Building at 1435 K St. NW until 1925. Then the Law Library moved to the fourth floor and part of the third floor of Stockton Hall (720 20th St. NW) through 1967 with intermited storage times in the basement of Linser Library on G St. NW. During the 1950s plans for the National Law Center building were abortive but allowed a partial fund for the Jacob Burns Law Library. In 1967, the Law Library moved into the Jacob Burns Law Library next door to Stockton Hall at 716 20th St. NW. The building is designed to hold 170,000 volumes, four reading rooms, a seminar room, offices, and space for microform readers. In 2005, the library grew to hold over 500,000 volumes.

During 1865-1866, the Law School was revived with the prospectus stating that ""the Library of the Law School will be furnished with all the important Text Books, Reports, and other Books of reference. The unequalled collection of the Congressional Library is open during six hours of each day to all who wish to examine any authority, or to take notes from any book of reference, ancient or modern."" The Law School focused on the United States courts, the District of Columbia courts, and adjacent states with the knowledge of the Library of Congress's Law Library and the other University libraries could fill in many of the gaps for students. In 1929, the library started a card catalogue using the Library of Congress cards and in 1969 the new Library of Congress KF schedule. In 1932, the Law Library stated a periodical exchange program using ""George Washington Law Review"" to develop its periodical collection. Under David L. Moore in 1946, the library placed a standing order for all United Nations publications published in English. During the 1950s the University Library acquired the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which the Law Library incorporated part into its holdings. A faculty library committee serves to assist directing the library's development for the Library School. 

During the 1920s-1930s an endowment in memory of Professor William Arden Maury, which the collection is named after by faculty vote assisted the library to grow although the endowment did not reach a sufficient sum to endow the library. In 1965 Professor Emeritus James Oliver Murdock established the International and Foreign Law Acquisitions Endowment Fund for the National Law Center Library. This spread the collection to include more international works. Other gift funds assist enriching the library including the James C. Sapienza Memorial Fund.

One of the earliest known librarians for the Law Library was L.A. McGee and Professor W. R. Vance in 1904-1905. Rufus H. Tilton was the Law Librarian around 1909-1911. From 1921 to1922 Frances Elizabeth Park was librarian with around 10,000 volumes to maintain. Miss Helen Catherine Newman became an assistant librarian under Emanuel C. Davidove in 1923 and Ernest H. Oliver in 1925. Miss. Newman was the Law School secretary until she became the law librarian from 1927 to 1942 that started the card catalog and annual reports for the Law Library. Miss. Newman served as the national president of the American Association of Law Libraries, the editor or the ""Law Library Journal"", served as a GW Board of Trustee for two terms, and as the Librarian of the United States Supreme court from 1947-1965. During the three years after Miss Newman leaving GW, there were three interim librarians in order: W.D. Kilgore, Madora Jane Doherty, and Ellis Champlin. Ella Cooper Thomas then served from 1946 to 1952 to be succeeded by David L. Moore. In 1953, Miss. Bertha M. Rothe served as Law Librarian until 1960 when Hugh Y. Bernard took over the collection of 54,000. Rothe and Bernard were the first to have professional training in law and library science and work at the library. Bernard was the first full-time Law Librarian to be given faculty status in 1962.

/repositories/2/resources/206,C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers,MS2028,['120'],['resource'],"The C. Darwin Stolzenbach papers relate to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. The material dates from 1930 through 1988, with only one item, a report in Washington traffic problems, dating from 1930. The bulk of the documents date from 1960 to 1969. Documents dating from 1979 through 1988 are related primarily to Stolzenbach's three-year tenure as Chairman and President of the Institute for the Study of Transportation

The Papers were the private collection of C. Darwin Stolzenbach, accumulated over the course of twenty-five years. Information as to how he acquired many of those documents (such as related to the reading files and the civil action suits) is absent from either the donor file or Stolzenbach's personal correspondence. All rights, such as they were held by the donor at the time of transfer, were transferred to the George Washington University at the time of donation. Further, no restrictions on the use of the documents in the collection were made by the donor at the times of tranfer.

The C. Darwin Stolzenbach Papers, together with four other manuscript collections, were processed under a grant from the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. The grant, entitled ""The Nation's Hometown History"" was awarded in the fall of 1990. This collection complements other Department of Special Collections holdings related to the history of WMATA and of regional mass transportation. Relevant manuscript collections for further research include the: Cody Pfanstiehl Papers, WMATA Metro History Project Collection, WMATA Metrorail Specifications Collection, and Greater Washington Board of Trade Records.

C. Darwin Stolzenbach, who changed his last name to Fairweather sometime during the early 1980's, studied physics at MIT from 1932 to 1935. Soon thereafter, he moved to the Washington area, attending the George Washington University from 1939 to 1935, where he studied political science, and the American University from 1941 to 1942, studying public administration.

From 1941 to 1944 he served in the Office of the Chief of Engineers in the United States Army Air Forces as a program analyst. Following that, for four years beginning in 1944, Stolzenbach worked as an economist in the Bureau of the Budget, and beginning in 1948 as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Policy Planning. In 1951 he became a senior operations research analyst at the Johns Hopkins University's Operations Research Office. There he conducted assessments of the defense of the United States from attack by missiles and bombers.

In 1961, Stolzenbach was named by President Kennedy to replace H. Holmes Vogel as Administrator of the National Capital Transportation Agency (NCTA), who had himself been appointed by President Eisenhower. Until his resignation in 1965, Stolzenbach oversaw the development and application of a comprehensive highway and mass transit plan for the National Capital region. By 1965, the NCTA had laid the foundations for a subway system and drafted plans for the proposed Inner Loop, I-266, and Three Sisters Bridge projects. In his letter of resignation, Stolzenbach made it clear that the research and operations analysis having been completed, Stolzenbach believed that he had guided the NCTA through those phases that required his expertise. He was succeeded by Walter McCarter.

As an advisory agency, the NCTA did not actually implement the plans that it proposed. That job fell to the Department of Transportation. However, the Agency did conduct extensive research and studies to determine the feasibility of subways and inner-city expressways. Most of the highway proposals submitted by the NCTA were eventually abandoned; controversy and lawsuits slowed their development for over ten years. The subway system was not adopted in the form proposed by the NCTA, but served as the basis for the system proposed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). WMATA succeeded the NCTA as the agency charged with implementing the Capital-region mass transit proj ect. Established in 1967 by a Charter between the governments of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, the WMATA was granted the authority to construct, not merely advise. In this capacity, WMATA completed at least part of the work first mapped out by the NCTA.

First in 1979 and again in 1984, Stolzenbach established research projects. The first, the Metro History Project, was funded by a grant from the Mass Transportation Administration. The second, the Institute for the Study of Transportation, was a taxexempt research organization. Both projects were dedicated to writing monographs and manuscripts on the history of the highway and subway projects in the Washington area. Apparently, much of the material in Stolzenbach's collection was reorganized as he consulted it during his research.

/repositories/2/resources/257,"Mutual Broadcasting System, Inc. records",MS2083,['168'],['resource'],"The Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS) was an American radio network, in operation from 1934 to 1999. Of the four national networks of American radio's classic era, Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates but the least certain financial position. In the golden age of U.S. radio drama, MBS was best known as the original network home of ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Adventures of Superman"" and as the long-time radio residence of ""The Shadow"". For many years, it was the national broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series and Notre Dame football. From the mid-1930s and for decades after, Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows. Toward the end of its run as a major programmer, it introduced the country to Larry King.

For the first eighteen years of its existence, MBS was owned and operated as a cooperative, setting the network apart from its competitors: Mutual's members shared their own original programming, transmission and promotion expenses, and advertising revenues. By late 1936, the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast. Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions.

Once General Tire sold the network in 1957, Mutual's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served, leading to a more conventional, top-down model of program production and distribution. Not long after the sale, one of the network's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda. The network was severely damaged, but soon rebounded. Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding yearseven leaving aside larger-scale acquisitions and mergers, its final direct corporate parent, Westwood One, which purchased it in 1985, was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire. 19341935: The launch of Mutual Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s. In 1929, a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network. Five years later, a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System.[1] Mutual's original participating stations were WORNewark, New Jersey, just outside of New York (owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a division of R.H. Macy and Company), WGNChicago (owned by WGN Inc., a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune), WXYZDetroit (owned by Kunsky-Trendle Broadcasting), and WLWCincinnati (owned by the Crosley Radio Company). The network was organized on September 29, 1934, with the members contracting for telephone-line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows. WOR and WGN, based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming, were the acknowledged leaders of the group. On October 29, 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System was incorporated, with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 percent of the stockfive each of the ten total shares.[2]

 It is often claimed that MBS was launched primarily as a vehicle for The Lone Ranger, but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time.[3] Abner is seen in this advertisement reaching for a can of Horlick's. The malted milk maker sponsored the show during its entire run on Mutual. It left MBS for NBC Blue after August 1935.The three national radio networks already in operationthe Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company's NBC Red and NBC Bluewere corporate controlled: programming was produced by the network and distributed to affiliates, most of which were independently owned. In contrast, the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture, with programming produced by and shared between the group's members. The majority of the early programming, from WOR and WGN, consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials. WOR had The Witch's Tale, a horror anthology series whose ""hunner-an'-thirteen-year-old"" narrator invited listeners to ""douse all [the] lights. Now draw up to the fire an' gaze into the embers...gaaaaze into 'em deep!...an' soon ye'll be across the seas, in th' jungle land of Africa...hear that chantin' and them savage drums?""[4] WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner. Detroit's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger; the Western serial had been launched in 1933 and was already in demand. What WLW brought was sheer power; billing itself as ""The Nation's Station,"" in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500,000 watts, ten times the clear-channel standard.[5]

On May 24, 1935, the network aired its inaugural live eventthe first-ever night baseball game, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies.[6] In September, WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue, though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual, airing three times a week, through spring 1942.[7] The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor, Ontario, just across the river.[8] In October, the network began a decades-long run as broadcaster of baseball's World Series, with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW's Red Barber (NBC and CBS also carried the series that year; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938).[9] Mutual also broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn, beginning another relationship that would last for decades.[10] As an income-generating business, the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start: in the first eleven months of 1935, the cooperative garnered $1.1 million in advertising, compared to NBC's $28.3 million and CBS's $15.8 million.[11]

 Late 1930s: National expansion In the fall of 1936, Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed. The network, however, was in the midst of a major expansion: the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship, WAAB, and thirteen affiliates around New England.[12] Cleveland's WGAR also became an affiliate, as did five Midwestern stations: KSLGSt. Louis, Mo.; KSODes Moines, Iowa; WMTCedar Rapids, Iowa; KOILOmaha, Neb.; and KFORLincoln, Neb.[13] The big prize came in December, when the Don Lee Broadcasting System, the leading regional web on the West Coast, left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual. Don Lee brought its four owned-and-operated stationsKHJLos Angeles, KFRCSan Francisco, KGBSan Diego, and KDBSanta Barbaraalong with six California affiliates and, via shortwave hookup, two more in Hawaii.[14] Mutual now had a nationwide presence. During 1936, as well, an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected.[15]

In January 1937, ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial.[16] The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the MBS affiliate roster.[17] WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of the Cleveland Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK.[18] Within a few years, this new Ohio participant would become one of the network's central members, a shareowner in MBS. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS.[19] The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, and the fact that the lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.

 At first, Orson Welles played the part of the Shadow anonymously. But, as one chronicler puts it, ""nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long.""[20] A predecessor in the role delivered the show's intro, with its famous catchphrase, ""Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows...."" According to historian Frank Brady, Welles's ""voice as the 'invisible' Shadow was perfect."" The intro, however, also called for a sinister chuckle; Welles's effort ""seemed more an adolescent giggle than a terrifying threat.""[21]

Programming: The Shadow and diverse political voices On the programming front, 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show, The Good Will Hour, hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden. The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony, which had aired on a local New York station in 1932, ""dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code."" Anthony, whose real name was Lester Kroll, brought a wealth of relevant experience to his workhe had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments.[22] In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven-part adaptation of Les Misérables, produced, written, and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performersMercury's first appearance on the air. September 26, 1937, proved a particularly momentous date: that evening, The Shadow came to Mutual. The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history. For the first year of its Mutual run, Welles provided the voice of the Shadow and his newly created alter ego, Lamont Cranston.

In April 1938, the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first national exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940).[23] MBS also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and His Kollege of Musical Knowledge; Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience.[24] By May 1939, MBS was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500.[25] That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual ""offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."" This was the first example given in the ruling of ""abuses"" perpretrated by the two leading broadcast companies.[26]

Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping ""trial of the century"" in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week.[27] In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs.[28] In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later.[29] In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the European mainland. The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.[30]

 1940s: One of the ""Big Four"" Early in 1940, the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive, as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose:

Until January, 1940, six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree: stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit; the Colonial Network in New England, the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast, and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, participated in responsibility for running expenses. A new contract effective February 1, 1940, provides for contributing membership by all the above group[s] plus station CKLW in Detroit-Windsor. These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network.... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups, together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations.[31]

 Mutual featured a variety of political voices, but none for so long as that of conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr. As described by historians Dan Nimmo and Chevelle Newsome, many later pundits ""copied his stylemocking, ridiculing, full of denials, full of sweeping generalizations, and full of inside-dopsterism.""[32] WKIC was Mutual's affiliate in Hazard, Kentucky.The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of WKRC in Cincinnati, which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market. The MBS corporation now had 100 shares, apportioned as follows:[33]

Shareholder Lead station Shares Bamberger Broadcasting WOR 25 WGN Inc. WGN 25 Don Lee Network KHJ 25 Colonial Network WAAB 6 United Broadcasting WHK 6 Western Ontario Broadcasting CKLW 6 Cincinnati Times-Star WKRC 6 Fred Weber MBS general manager 1 

In 1941, WOR's official city of license was changed to New York. Within two years, the Colonial Network's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard; WNAC was the sole flagship, WAAB having been moved to western Massachusetts to avoid duopoly restrictions. With WBZ taking over its slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston, WNAC switched to Mutual. In January 1943, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the sale of the Yankee Networkwith WNAC, its three other owned-and-operated stations, its contracts with 17 additional affiliates, and its Mutual sharesto the Ohio-based General Tire and Rubber Company.[34]

Already by 1940, MBS was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size.[35] Still, because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones, the network lagged way behind in advertising revenueNBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year.[36] In 1941, the FCC, calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks, observed that the company ""has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red.... Mutual is excluded from, or only lamely admitted to, many important markets.""[37] On January 10, 1942, Mutual filed a $10.275 million suit against NBC and its owner, RCA, alleging a conspiracy ""hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nation-wide network programs.""[38] The FCC's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit.[39] But these developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to MBSthe transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual's competitive position. In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates, and by December 1948, Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States.[40] But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual's part to attract leading stations from the corporate-controlled networks. Rather, the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations, facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets: between 1945 and 1952, the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2,350.[41] It was these new, relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up. Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network, for the most part they remained ""less desirable in frequency, power, and coverage,"" as the Supreme Court had put it.[42] For instance, in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations. MBS needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage.[43]

 Logo for KFRC, the Mutual station in San Francisco, owned by the Don Lee Broadcasting System.Late in the decade, there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network, serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent.[44] The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. radio networks not to start (and eventually be dominated by) a television network. While there was no Mutual TV network, this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television's early development. The cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium, including two of the era's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and ""reality"" programming: the crabby gabfest Leave It to the Girls and, in particular, Queen for a Day, which both started on Mutual radio in 1945. Referred to by some as a ""misery show,"" Queen for a Day ""awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart-stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden.... On one show, a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled himand who, by the way, also needed heart surgery.""[45] In May 1947, a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system's experimental TV station in Los Angeles, W6XAO (later KTSL). It was a smash hit, and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings.[46] In the 1950s, Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show.

 Programming: World War II and Superman Offscreen, Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule of news and opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis.[47] Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS.[48] At 2:26 p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier.[49] In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück.[50] For a year and a half in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow.[51] In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and its own affiliates in the segregated South.[52]

To the left, in the rear, a disc jockey and three phonographs (at least) provide music and sound effects.In the field of entertainment, Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow. WGN's The Theater of the Air, featuring hour-long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience, was broadcast for the first time in May 1940. By 1943, the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4,000 strong, gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus. The Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955.[53] Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential, iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan, whose show Here's Morgan began its network run in October 1940. Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942, within a few months Mutual had another reliable, and no less famous, action hero. The Adventures of Superman, picked up from WOR, would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949. In April 1943, Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest-lasting shows: debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter, Master Detective, it would be a network staple through September 1955. From May 1943 through May 1946, Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936; a less starry version would return to MBS from September 1947 through June 1949.[54] The Mysterious Traveler, a protoTwilight Zone anthology series, aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952.

In February 1946, MBS introduced a quiz show, Twenty Questions, that would run for more than seven years. In October, the detective series Let George Do It, starring Bob Bailey, launched as a Mutual/Don Lee presentation; it would also run into the mid-1950s. For two years, also starting in 1946, Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual/Don Lee morning show Smile Time, out of Los Angeles's KHJ. In February 1947, the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars, the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years. That March, Kate Smith, a major star on CBS since 1931, moved over to Mutual. During most of her initial run at the network, which lasted until September 1951, she had two distinct weekday shows, each 15 minutes long: Kate Smith Speaks, at noon, and Kate Smith Sings, later in the hour.[55] The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist Wyllis Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet, Please, which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948. It also aired actor Alan Ladd's similarly lauded drama about a crime-solving mystery novelist, Box 13, which ran for precisely a year. Its 52 episodes, which aired every Sunday beginning August 22, 1948, were produced by Ladd's own company, Mayfair Productions.

1950s: New ownership On the radio in the morning, on TV in the afternoonaudiences couldn't get enough of Queen for a Day. At the end of each episode, host Jack Bailey would proclaim, ""We wish we could make every lady in America a queen for every single day!""[56]Toward the end of 1950, the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee (the son of Don Lee, who had died in 1936) decided to liquidate the estate's interests in the broadcasting field. The Don Lee Broadcasting System, with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System, was sold to General Tire (which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings).[57] Around the same time, MBS acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. Mutual may have been reindulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.[58]

Early in 1952, General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company. With the deal, General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio, under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division (Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation's capital, WOIC, to CBS and the Washington Post).[59] Most importantly, as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned, WOR's founding shares in the network, when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings, gave General Tire majority control of MBS.[60] That same year, NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual. As a measure of the afternoon show's success, its audience at its new Los Angeles home, General Teleradio/Don Lee's KHJ-TV, was triple that of the city's six other stations combined.[61] Mutual might not have had a TV network, but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television.[62]

Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers, by farit had 560, almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors, CBS (194) and NBC (191).[63] In 1955, General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes, only to close the movie studio a year and a half later (General Teleradio, renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition, would soon be known as RKO General). General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control. Indeed, in 1956, General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder, Western Ontario Broadcasting, and its station in Windsor, CKLW. In July 1957, General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer.[64]

 Perry Como for Chesterfield, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays...The network soon changed hands again: in September 1958, it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation.[65] Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company, whose chairman, Alexander Guterma, envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase, the Hal Roach movie studio. After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties, Guterma stepped down. Mutual, by this point, was floundering. For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested (General Tire, Armand Hammer) or now, as a growing amount of evidence would show, criminal. Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing: major advertisers were abandoning radio for television. Commercial rates had been cut. Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced, in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire seasonbut there was no reversing the trend. The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of nonsponsored programs, known as ""sustaining"" shows in the industry.[66] The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the ""mass desertion of network radio talent, management and technicians for television.... [T]hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks.""[67]

Under its new chairman, Hal Roach Jr., F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In September 1959, Guterma, Roach, and Garland Culpepper, a Scranton Corp. vice president, were indicted for failing to register as ""foreign agents""; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs.[68] It was never proven that Guterma, who was identified as the primary player on Mutual's side and pleaded no contest to the charge, actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage. Nonetheless, the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual.[69] Whether precipitated by the scandal or not, among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network's two original flagships, WOR.[70] Businessman Albert G. McCarthy, meanwhile, had taken over the network, arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis.[71]

 ...Eddie Fisher for Coca-Cola, Tuesdays and Thursdays. That's how Mutual made music in 1954. [edit] Programming: Korean War and original drama's decline Before the Guterma fiasco, the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization. As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid-1950, Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation, featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot, military analyst for CBS during World War II. By August, Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea, more than ABC or NBC.[72] In June 1958, just a few months before the Scranton takeover, the network had launched a nightly 25-minute newscast, The World Today, hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis, famous as the voice of The March of Time. On occasion, Mutual's commentary programs made the news: On March 11, 1954, Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest, two days after the senator's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now, hosted by Edward Murrow. In his radio interview, McCarthy dismissed Murrow as ""the extreme left-wing, bleeding-heart element of television.""[73]

By the end of the 1950s, Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming. Early in the decade, however, it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon, which had originated at MBS cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station's departure from the network. The show, subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955. In 1950 as well, Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus, which first aired on March 15, almost a month before the premiere of NBC's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow's long run finally ended in December 1954. In November 1957, Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half-hour original dramatic shows, Counterspy and Gang Busters, both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade. It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series. In 1955, the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five-day-a-week afternoon show.[74] Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series, which ran from January to August.[75] Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual's schedule: the network began regularly airing a baseball Game of the Day, every day except Sunday. This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s.[76] In 1958, MBS secured exclusive radio network rights to Notre Dame football, which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of Mutual's existence.[77]

 1960s1970s: Narrowed focus Advertisement for the Mutual Black Network, featuring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and poet Nikki Giovanni.In the spring of 1960, the 3M Company stepped in, purchasing Mutual and restoring much-needed stability to the operation.[78] Despite the recent scandal, MBS still had 443 affiliates, easily the most of any network. By this time, as historian Jim Cox describes, both Mutual and ABC ""had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programmingsave news and sporting events and a few long-running features.""[79] This would characterize Mutual's essential approach for the next three and a half decades, through a further series of ownership changes.

In July 1966, 3M sold the network to a privately held company headed by John P. Fraim.[80] The following month, after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr., his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday-to-Friday, 7 p.m. slot.[81] When ABC Radio ""split"" into four demographically targeted networks on January 1, 1968, Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move. Four years later, under new president C. Edward Little, Mutual began its own niche programming services, taking advantage, like ABC, of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations, of whatever primary format, regularly air news and public affairs (a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s). On May 1, 1972, the network launched the Mutual Black Network (MBN) and Mutual Cadena Hispánica (aka the Mutual Spanish Network); each provided 100 five-minute-long news and sports capsules a week, along with other programming.[82] While the Spanish-language service would be short-lived, by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates.[83] It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation, leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks.[84] Additional targeted services, such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio, followed from MBS.

 In September 1973, Mutual began airing one of the last significant original dramatic series in the history of U.S. radio. Rod Serling's five-day-a-week anthology show Zero Hour ran for two seasons.[85] It touched off a small wave of new radio dramas, including CBS Radio Mystery Theater.On September 30, 1977, Amway bought the network.[86] Soon after the purchase, Mutual began developing what would become become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity.[87] In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor to serve as Mutual's flagship. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS.[88] It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.

 Programming: Rise of the call-in talk show One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history: the first nationwide, all-night call-in show, which launched on November 3, 1975, with Herb Jepko as host. Jepko, who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years, so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived. Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel, before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami. Larry King made his network premiere on January 30, 1978; by the turn of the decade, he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to Mutual.[89] King continued his MBS call-in show for years, even as he began appearing on television in the mid-1980s. From 1970 through 1977, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football.

 1980s1990s: The end of Mutual In 1980, Amway purchased WHN in New York, giving Mutual a second major-market owned-and-operated station. At the beginning of the year, MBS had started airing Mutual Radio Theater, a renamed version of Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as party of the anthology series.[90] In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of MBS.[91] The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, had its final show on December 19, 1981.[92] In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL flagship to Statewide Broadcasting.[93] A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.[94] In 1985, a suitor came calling for the network itself.

 Ad for Dick Clark's National Music Survey, among the last entertainment shows to originate on Mutual.Westwood One, a major radio production company and syndicatora budding network, in shortwas looking to expand its operations. Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, much of it in the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four.[95] In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million.[96] ""It's a perfect fit,"" declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it ""a classic case of two plus two equaling five.""[97] In 1987, the number got even bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. With Mutual now part of a much larger programming service, a slow phase out of its identity was perhaps inevitable. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood Onebranded show.[98] Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994.[99] In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion.[100] The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.

At this point, Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate's Westwood One division. Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio, the former main MBS facility in Crystal City, Virginia.[101] In April 1999, Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radioyet another acquisition. A former member of the news team described the end: ""Official time of Mutual Radio's death was Midnight 4/17/99. No tribute, no mention it was the last newscast...it just died.""[102] The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001, and Westwood's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City.[103] As of early 2007, Jim Bohannon was still on the air hosting a call-in show tracing directly back to Herb Jepko's 1975 launch on MBS, long after Mutual itself was gone.

/repositories/2/resources/204,William R. Perl papers,MS2026,['4'],['resource'],"The William R. Perl Papers document the education, professional career and social activism of William R. Perl (1906-1998). The collection is stored in 10 manuscript boxes, 1 audio cassette box and 1 oversized box. A large portion of the collection consists of undated photocopies and photostats of original documents. The Papers are arranged into eight series: Biographical Files, Jewish Activism Files, Military Service Files, Professional Files, Legal Files, Miscellaneous Writings, Miscellaneous Correspondence, and Mixed Media. In terms of physical extent, the largest series are the Jewish Activism Files and the Military Service Files. 

Earliest records in this collection relate to William R. Perl's high school and university education (1920s). Obituaries of Perl (1998) are the most recent documents. However, the bulk of the William R. Perl Papers date from the 1940s (after Perl emigrated to the United States), through the 1980s (when Perl received increased recognition for his work during the Holocaust). Early papers (and papers relating to the earlier part of Perl's life) are often written in German, while most papers dating after 1941 are in English. 

Of particular interest to researchers are correspondence, copies of official documents, artifacts and other materials relating to Perl's involvement in transporting European Jewish refugees to Palestine. These papers are filed in the Rescue of European Jews Files sub-series of the Jewish Activism Series. To understand the context of the items, researchers are strongly urged to read Reuven Schlenker and Charles Goolsby's manuscript The World of Willi Perl, Perl's own books The Four Front War and Operation Action, clippings in the various Newsclippings sub-series of the Perl Papers, and other biographical treatments of Perl. Such secondary readings will help the researcher fill intellectual gaps and determine the basic facts of events prior to using original materials in the rest of the collection.

Also of note are affidavits and photographs of German soldiers who participated in the ""massacre"" of American soldiers in Malmedy, Belgium in 1944. Though many of the affidavits are incomplete photocopies of originals and their authors could not always be identified by the Manuscripts Librarian, some affidavits are original documents which may not have been accessible to the public until now. Most of the affidavits are handwritten in old German script (making them difficult to read) but for some documents a typewritten English translation is available. Whenever possible, the Manuscripts Librarian has identified the author and date of affidavits and listed such information in the Container List of this finding aid.

 There are several notable gaps in the coverage of the William R. Perl Papers. There is little documentation of Perl's life prior to his emigration to the United States, though a major exception are documents relating to Perl's rescue of European Jews. The Perl Papers also contain little documentation of Perl's career as a psychologist (ca. 1950-1968) other than newsclippings and Perl's own writings and public speeches. Other than one folder of correspondence and some flyers and photographs, there is little evidence (meeting minutes or notes) about the Jewish Defense League, of which Perl was President. Most of the Correspondence files in the collection contain only one letter to or from a given correspondent, and many folders relating to Perl's public speeches and honors only contain a program, letter or other ephemeral item. Lastly, the Papers contain very little information about Perl's wife, Lore (Rollig) Perl, their children, or other members of the Perl family. Again, researchers are encouraged to consult secondary sources and other repositories for further information about the life and times of William R. Perl.

The National Archives and Records Administration (Washington, D.C.), the Simon Wiesenthal Center (Los Angeles), and the Public Records Office (Kew, Surrey, England) are three known repositories that have documentation relating to Perl's activities (copies of documents from these repositories can be found in the Perl Papers). The National Archives has documentation of War Crimes trials at Dachau, contained in Record Group 111 (United States Department of Defense, United States Army), Record Group 331 (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Judge Advocate Section, War Crimes Division) and other record groups. To date, the Manuscripts Librarian could not find information about relevant archival holdings at the Wiesenthal Center or the Public Records Office. Upon their arrival to the Special Collections Department, the William R. Perl Papers were largely unarranged (though some documents were grouped by topic), and the provenance of some documents was uncertain or difficult to establish. In order to make the Perl Papers more usable to researchers, the Manuscripts Librarian identified different aspects of Perl's career (e.g., Jewish Activism, Military Service, etc.). as series for the Papers. Thereunder, items documenting similar kinds of activities (writings, speeches, correspondence, etc.), were grouped together, and thereunder, most documents were arranged in chronological order. One exception to chronological arrangement are Correspondence sub-series, which are arranged alphabetically by last name of correspondent. 

Out of concerns for preservation, photographs, audio recordings and oversized materials were organized as a separate, ""Mixed Media"" series, and grouped together by media. As a preservation measure, most original newsclippings have been photocopied onto acid-free paper. Photographs have been placed in mylar sleeves to protect them from handling.

Several books were donated with the William R. Perl Papers:

Merlin, Samuel. Jabotinsky Returns to the Land of Israel. Tel-Aviv: Hadar Publishing Company, 1965. Seewann, Harald. Theodor Herzl und die Akademische Jugend. Graz: H. Seewann, 1998 (2 copies). Seewann, Harald. Zirkel und Zionsstern: Bilder und Dokumente aus der versunkenen Welt des Jüdisch Nationalen Korporationswesens : ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Zionismus auf Akademischem Boden. Graz: Harald Seewann, 1992 (2 copies). 

These were removed from the collection, cataloged individually and shelved in the Special Collections Department's general stacks.

In the container list, the designation ""n.d."" is used to mark folders that contain undated documents, and such documents are filed at the end of folders. ""WRP"" is used to designate William R. Perl. The terms ""unidentified"" ""unattributed"" and ""illegible"" are used when a good-faith effort on the part of the Manuscripts Librarian to determine speakers, authors, or other identifying information failed.
